# TEMPLATE ENGINE

```The files/code written within this repository offer a command line application that (in this case) is used for generating a software-engineering team's profile page. Thus, the CLI allows a user to input information that will be used as content within a series of HTML files. In turn, these files will produce a webpage portraying the various positions held within the team, as well as contact information for each team member```
